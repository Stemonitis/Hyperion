#getextraterrestial sun

The MODTRAN extraterrestrial spectra are high-resolution, with approximately 50,000 data points at 1 wavenumber (1 cm-1) resolution.

The MODTRAN ETR spectra are grouped in a tab delimited text file. The file includes Chance+Kurucz (MChKur), Cebula+Kurucz (MCebKur), New Kurucz (MNewKur), Thullier+Kurucz (MThKur), Old Kurucz (MOldKur) and the Wherli 1985 (MWherli_WMO) spectra, based on combinations of data from the references. These spectra contain 49,951 wavelengths, except for the MOldKur.dat, which contains 49,934 wavelengths. The original spectral step size (resolution) is normally 1 cm-1 for these files.

These spectra have been converted to wavelength (nm), irradiance (W m-2 nm-1) units from the units of wavenumber (cm-1) versus irradiance (W cm-2 cm-1) used in MODTRAN.
